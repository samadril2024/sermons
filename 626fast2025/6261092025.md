## 4. Trust God’s Answers to Prayer
- **Reflection:**  
  If God had answered all your prayers the way you wanted, you might be worse off than you are now.  
  Trust isn’t about telling God what to do; it’s releasing the struggle to Him completely.  

- **Key Insight:**  
  Fleshly perspective might view God's way as the “wrong choice,” but He sees the future and ensures we reach where we need to be.  
  He meets all our needs and makes a way where there seems to be none.
