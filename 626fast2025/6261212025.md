## Scripture References

- **Exodus 13:17**\
  "When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them on the road through the Philistine country, though that was shorter. For God said, 'If they face war, they might change their minds and return to Egypt.'"

- **Exodus 14:3-11**\
  "Pharaoh will think, 'The Israelites are wandering around the land in confusion, hemmed in by the desert.' And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and he will pursue them. But I will gain glory for myself through Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord.' So the Israelites did this. When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds about them and said, 'What have we done? We have let the Israelites go and have lost their services!' So he had his chariot made ready and took his army with him. He took six hundred of the best chariots, along with all the other chariots of Egypt, with officers over all of them. The Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, so that he pursued the Israelites, who were marching out boldly. The Egyptians—all Pharaoh’s horses and chariots, horsemen and troops—pursued the Israelites and overtook them as they camped by the sea near Pi Hahiroth, opposite Baal Zephon. As Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up, and there were the Egyptians, marching after them. They were terrified and cried out to the Lord. They said to Moses, 'Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you brought us to the desert to die? What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt?'

- **Exodus 14:14**\
  "The Lord will fight for you; you need only to be still."

- **Exodus 14:21-22**\
  "Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and all that night the Lord drove the sea back with a strong east wind and turned it into dry land. The waters were divided, and the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with a wall of water on their right and on their left."

- **Exodus 14:24**\
  "During the last watch of the night the Lord looked down from the pillar of fire and cloud at the Egyptian army and threw it into confusion."

## Main Theme

### There is a need in the last few days:

- **Emotional responses after fasting:**
  - Experiencing answered prayers as a testament to His faithfulness.
  - Struggling with the weight of prayers yet to be fulfilled.

### Holding on during the wait:

- **Exodus 13:17**

  - God’s people were still waiting on their promise.
  - Despite 10 displays of power that led to Pharaoh releasing them, God’s direction was not straightforward.
  - God avoided leading them through the Philistine territory because He knew their hearts. If faced with war, they might turn back to Egypt.
  - **Key point:** God sometimes takes us the long way because He knows it’s necessary to prepare us and protect us.

- **God’s wisdom in avoiding unnecessary battles:**

  - He knows us deeply and shields us from situations we aren’t ready to face.

### Trusting God’s timing and plan:

- **Exodus 14:21-22**

  - God will make a way when there is no way. He uses those who believe to show His presence (Moses).

- **Exodus 14:3-11**

  - Pharaoh thought the Israelites were wandering in confusion, which led him to pursue them.
  - God hardened Pharaoh’s heart to demonstrate His power.
  - The Israelites doubted and complained to Moses, questioning why they were brought out of Egypt to die.
  - Yet again, God intervened and showed His faithfulness.

### God’s promises extend beyond us:

- **Exodus 14:14**

  - “The Lord will fight for you; you need only to be still.”
  - Even in fear and uncertainty, God’s presence remains constant.

- **Israelites’ reaction during battle:**

  - Despite God’s visible presence as a pillar of fire, they panicked.
  - **Reminder:** In the midst of our battles, keep your focus on God.

### God’s perfect timing:

- **Exodus 14:24**

  - During the last watch of the night, the Lord took action.

- **Lessons from the Israelites’ fear and forgetfulness:**

  - They became comfortable and lost sight of God’s presence, even though He had already done so much for them and was visibly present.
  - **Encouragement:** Ask God to renew your focus on Him and to remind you of His presence and power.

### Closing Reflection

- **Focus:**
  - Stay rooted in God’s promises, even during prolonged waiting periods.
  - Trust His plans and timing, knowing He sees the bigger picture.
- **Prayer:**
  - Seek reminders of His presence and ask for strength to remain steadfast in faith.
