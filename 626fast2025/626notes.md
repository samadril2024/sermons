### B. Be Precise  
- Don’t be vague in your prayers.  
- Use clear terms like "move," "bless," or "touch" instead of overthinking or generalizing your requests.  
- Be specific about what you need from God.

  Memorize and meditate on them to guide you through challenges.  

- **Key Scripture:**

  *“Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to Him, and He will make your paths straight.”*  

  - **Breakdown:**

## 4. Trust God’s Answers to Prayer
- **Reflection:**  
  If God had answered all your prayers the way you wanted, you might be worse off than you are now.  
  Trust isn’t about telling God what to do; it’s releasing the struggle to Him completely.  

- **Key Insight:**  
  Fleshly perspective might view God's way as the “wrong choice,” but He sees the future and ensures we reach where we need to be.  
  He meets all our needs and makes a way where there seems to be none.  

---

## Takeaway
Trusting God with your prayers means letting go of control, embracing His peace, and walking the path He has set. Trust eliminates worry and aligns us with His perfect will.
