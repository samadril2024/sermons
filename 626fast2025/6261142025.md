Then He said to them, “My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here and watch with Me.” He went a little farther and fell on His face, and prayed, saying, “O My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will.” Then He came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, “What! Could you not watch with Me one hour? Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.” Again, a second time, He went away and prayed, saying, “O My Father, if this cup cannot pass away from Me unless I drink it, Your will be done.” And He came and found them asleep again, for their eyes were heavy. So He left them, went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words."

## Delight in the Lord

- `Fasting` and `Prayer` are spiritual Force Multipliers.
- `Delighting in the Lord` & `Aligning with God's will` multiply that force even more.

### Force Multiplier
- A Force Multiplier adds strength to what you do on your own, making your efforts go farther and faster with less effort.

### Scriptural Insights
1. **Psalm 37:25**  
   - David reflects: "I have been young and now am old; yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken."

2. **Psalm 37:4**  
   - "Delight yourself in the Lord, and He will give you the desires of your heart."

### Reflective Question

   - During prayer and fasting, is it a *duty* or a *delight*?

## Align with God's Will

- Aligning our will with God's will allows Him to fulfill the desires of our hearts.

### Practical Steps
1. Take inventory of the desires in your heart—both personal and spiritual.
2. Compare these desires with the Word of God to see if they align with His will.
3. Dedicate time to study and prayer to refine and align your desires.

### Scriptural Insights
1. **Habakkuk 2:2**  
   - "Write the vision and make it plain on tablets."
   - Writing your vision sparks clarity and commitment.
   - Where God gives vision, He also provides provision—in His appointed time.

### The Point of Consecration
- **Matthew 26:36-44**  
   - Jesus prays in Gethsemane, surrendering to God's will:
      - "If it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will."
   - Jesus prays the same words three times, fully consecrating Himself to God's purpose.
