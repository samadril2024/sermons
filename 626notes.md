   - Adam and Eve - Ate of fruit and then made clothes, covered up, and hid!
   - "If they really knew who you are, they would not accept you."
   - Shame grows in silence, secrecy, and judgment and is broken when shared.
   - **James 5:16** -> "Confess to one another and you will be healed."

2. **Resist Anxiety**

   - Anxiety is not sinful, but when it enters our prayer life, it disconnects us from God.
   - "It will slip into your prayer ... Worrying in Godâ€™s direction."
   - **1 Peter 5:6-7** -> "Cast all your anxieties on Him!"
   - Notice, name it, and share it with God, giving it to Him.

#### Main Point: 1 Thing to Drawing Near

1. **"Intimacy with God"**
   - Intimacy with God looks like many things but has one thing in common: "Intimacy with God."
   - **Genesis 45:4** -> "Joseph said to his brothers, 'Come near, I am your brother you sold into slavery.'"
   - Every time you pray, show up, sustain, resist the devil, etc., you are drawing near.
   - **Hebrews 4:16** -> "Let us with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, so that we might find Mercy and Grace when you are in need."
   - **James 4:7-8** -> Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw near to God and he will draw near to you.
   - When you are in need of direction, strength, healing, etc., ---- Draw Near!!!!
