   - "It will slip into your prayer ... Worrying in God’s direction."
   - **1 Peter 5:6-7** -> "Cast all your anxieties on Him!"
   - Notice, name it, and share it with God, giving it to Him.

#### Main Point: 1 Thing to Drawing Near

1. **"Intimacy with God"**
   - Intimacy with God looks like many things but has one thing in common: "Intimacy with God."
   - **Genesis 45:4** -> "Joseph said to his brothers, 'Come near, I am your brother you sold into slavery.'"
   - Every time you pray, show up, sustain, resist the devil, etc., you are drawing near.
   - **Hebrews 4:16** -> "Let us with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, so that we might find Mercy and Grace when you are in need."
   - **James 4:7-8** -> Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw near to God and he will draw near to you.
   - When you are in need of direction, strength, healing, etc., ---- Draw Near!!!!

**Topic:** Ask, Seek, Knock  
**Scripture Reference:** Matthew 7:7-8 (NIV)

## Key Points:  

### 1. Prayer is Relational

- How much more will our Heavenly Father, who is free of sin and evil, provide for and bless us?  

---

### 2. Everyone Has Needs  
- How do we access God’s power from heaven? **Simply ASK!**  
- Scripture emphasizes that everyone who asks receives. (Matthew 7:8)

### 3. Biblical Support  
- **James 4:2:** *"You do not have because you do not ask."*  
- **Mark 10:51:** The blind man, when asked what he needed, specifically requested his sight.

## Application:  

### A. Be Persistent  
- Keep asking, seeking, and knocking.  
- Persistence is key: continually approach God in prayer without giving up.  

---

### B. Be Precise  
- Don’t be vague in your prayers.  
- Use clear terms like "move," "bless," or "touch" instead of overthinking or generalizing your requests.  
- Be specific about what you need from God.  

---

### C. Be Like a Child  
- Children are unafraid to ask repeatedly and persistently for what they need.  
- Seek and knock with confidence, knowing that God welcomes your persistence.

## Conclusion  
God desires a relationship with His children and encourages us to come to Him boldly, consistently, and with specific requests. Keep asking, seeking, and knocking, trusting in His goodness and His perfect timing.
